# desktop-gym-app
A console based app for managing gym members and performing analyitical tests based on their data
This was the third and final assignment of the introduction to programming module for my higher diploma 
Computer Science conversion course. 
Ignore Driver, the app entr point is GymAPI. Before you can log in as a pre loaded member or trainer,
you must actually select the load members or load trainers option to load the xml files. Once done, 
you can log in as any member stored in the xml file. For simplicity, the member log in is email1 and
the trainer log in is email2. There is no password. You can register an account as a member or a trainer. 
Trainer accounts can see all member and all of their details. Due to a lack of security, this is not a safe
system in terms of data privacy, it is simply a proof of concept for a college assignment.
